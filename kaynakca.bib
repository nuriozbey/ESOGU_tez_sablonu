ABSTRACT = {Facial expression recognition is an interesting and challenging subject. Considering the nonlinear manifold structure of facial images, a new kernel-based manifold learning method, called kernel discriminant isometric mapping (KDIsomap), is proposed. KDIsomap aims to nonlinearly extract the discriminant information by maximizing the interclass scatter while minimizing the intraclass scatter in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. KDIsomap is used to perform nonlinear dimensionality reduction on the extracted local binary patterns (LBP) facial features, and produce low-dimensional discrimimant embedded data representations with striking performance improvement on facial expression recognition tasks. The nearest neighbor classifier with the Euclidean metric is used for facial expression classification. Facial expression recognition experiments are performed on two popular facial expression databases, i.e., the JAFFE database and the Cohn-Kanade database. Experimental results indicate that KDIsomap obtains the best accuracy of 81.59\% on the JAFFE database, and 94.88\% on the Cohn-Kanade database. KDIsomap outperforms the other used methods such as principal component analysis (PCA), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), kernel principal component analysis (KPCA), kernel linear discriminant analysis (KLDA) as well as kernel isometric mapping (KIsomap).},

Aiming at this problem, this paper analyzes the reasons for the low recognition rate of person-independent facial expression, and proposes a recognition algorithm of person-independent facial expression based on improved LBP (Local Binary Pattern) and HOSVD (Higher-Order Singular Value Decomposition). The algorithm has the following contributions of facial expression recognition framework. In the stage of facial expression feature extraction, the transient features extracted by LDP(Local Directional Pattern) and the persistent features extracted by CBP(Centralized Binary Pattern) are integrated to improve the discrimination of facial expression features. Moreover, in the stage of facial expression classification and recognition, the traditional nearest neighbor classification is changed into k-nearest neighbor pre-classification, and the regional energy calculated by HOSVD is used to determine the similarity of two images for secondary classification. Finally, in the extended Cohn-Kanade dataset and Oulu-CASIA NIR&VIS facial expression database, the theoretical analysis and experimental results show that the method has better recognition effect for solving the problem of person-independent facial expression recognition.},  keywords={},  doi={10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3032406},  ISSN={2169-3536},  month={},}

We report results on a series of experiments comparing recognition engines, including AdaBoost, support vector machines, linear discriminant analysis. We also explored feature selection techniques, including the use of AdaBoost for feature selection prior to classification by SVM or LDA. Best results were obtained by selecting a subset of Gabor filters using AdaBoost followed by classification with support vector machines. The system operates in real-time, and obtained 93\% correct generalization to novel subjects for a 7-way forced choice on the Cohn-Kanade expression dataset. The outputs of the classifiers change smoothly as a function of time and thus can be used to measure facial expression dynamics. We applied the system to to fully automated recognition of facial actions (FACS). The present system classifies 17 action units, whether they occur singly or in combination with other actions, with a mean accuracy of 94.8\%.

It is playing increasingly important role in the fields of human computer interaction, data-driven animation etc. Success of most facial image analysis solutions depend on an effective facial feature representation. This paper presents one such new appearance-based facial feature, the Local Monotonic Pattern (LMP). LMP can extract robust facial feature from a face image that gives accurate and reliable recognition performance for expression recognition. The LMP operator applied on a pixel, finds the monotonic intensity transition of neighboring pixels at different radii. The micro patterns thus found is enhanced with spatial information by tiling the image and taking histogram of each tile. The final feature vector is a collation of these histograms. This feature vector is then employed to classify expressions with well known machine learning method: Support Vector Machine (SVM). Experimental results using Cohn-Kanade expression database show that the LMP descriptor yields improved recognition rate against other existing appearance-based feature descriptors.},  keywords={},  doi={10.1109/ICCITechn.2011.6164854},  ISSN={},  month={12},}

Deriving an effective facial representation from original face images is a vital step for successful facial expression recognition. In this paper, we empirically evaluate facial representation based on statistical local features, Local Binary Patterns, for person-independent facial expression recognition. Different machine learning methods are systematically examined on several databases. Extensive experiments illustrate that LBP features are effective and efficient for facial expression recognition. We further formulate Boosted-LBP to extract the most discriminant LBP features, and the best recognition performance is obtained by using Support Vector Machine classifiers with Boosted-LBP features. Moreover, we investigate LBP features for low-resolution facial expression recognition, which is a critical problem but seldom addressed in the existing work. We observe in our experiments that LBP features perform stably and robustly over a useful range of low resolutions of face images, and yield promising performance in compressed low-resolution video sequences captured in real-world environments.}

% The microstructure and wear properties of a {WC} particle reinforced composite coating produced by the plasma transferred arc ({PTA}) method on Ti6Al4V alloy were investigated in this study. {PTA} processing was carried out using argon as the plasma gas at arc current values of 70 A, 80 A and 90 A. Scanning electron microscopy ({SEM}), X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy ({EDS}) and X-ray diffraction ({XRD}) were used to characterize the microstructure of the composite layer formed on the surface of a Ti6Al4V substrate. The results indicate that the {WC}, {TiC} and W2C carbide phases formed in the composite layers produced by {PTA} on the surface of the Ti6Al4V alloy. The distributions and volume fractions of these phases were found to vary with the arc current values. Wear tests were performed under dry sliding conditions using a linear ball-on-disc geometry. The microhardness and wear resistances of all of the composite layers produced by the {PTA} process were enhanced relative to those of the Ti6Al4V substrate. The homogeneity and volume fractions of the carbide phases in the composite layers were responsible for the improvement in the wear resistance of the alloy. The wear test results indicate that the alloy modified at 70 A shows better wear resistance than the alloys modified at 80 A and 90 A.},

An experimental campaign has been carried out on the deposition of two nickel- and a cobalt-base superalloys: Hastelloy 276, Inconel 625 and Stellite 6. Benchmarks of C-Mn steel have been chosen to test geometrical configurations that are critical for the application (corners and grooves). Specimen characterisation through liquid penetration inspection, optical- and scanning electron microscopy and microhardness tests proved that process parameters optimisation depends only on the geometrical configuration and not on the deposited alloy. This result suggests the importance of an accurate design of the reciprocal positioning and movement between the torch and the part to be coated, as a function of the deposition geometry.},

Based on the experiment results it is found that Fe–B4C composite coatings can only be prepared by {PTA} powder surfacing in the case that the employed surfacing current is little enough. The metallurgical reactions between Fe and B4C are limited in a very narrow region at their contacting interface in this case. With the increasing of employed surfacing current more and more B4C particles will be fully melted and reacted with the liquid iron-based alloys. However, the products of the metallurgical reactions between them are various for the different powder compositions and surfacing conditions. Most of the B4C particles will be fully melted during the {PTA} powder surfacing while 200 A or greater surfacing current is used. Furthermore, most of the C element in B4C particles is tending to be graphite rather than reacting with Fe to be carbides during the processing under the Fe–B4C composite powder {PTA} surfacing conditions.},

The results showed that nanostructured bainitic ferrite and carbon-enriched retained austenite distributed uniformly in the coating. Blocky retained austenite was confined to the prior austenite grain boundaries resulting from the elements segregation. The bainitic microstructure obtained at 250 °C had a finer scale compared with that obtained at 300 °C. The volume fraction of austenite increased with increasing transformation temperature for the fully transformed bainitic coating. The bainitic transformation was accelerated as a result of the fine prior austenite generated during the laser cladding. The evolution of the carbon contents in bainitic ferrite and retained austenite revealed the diffusionless mechanism of the bainitic transformation.},

A Gleeble system was used to simulate various {CGHAZs} as a function of heat input. The segregation behavior of boron in the {CGHAZ} was estimated through secondary ion mass spectrometry ({SIMS}) and particle tracking autoradiography ({PTA}). Vickers hardness and Charpy impact tests were performed in order to assess the mechanical properties of the {CGHAZs}. In the steel containing 30 ppm of boron, boron segregation was relatively high even with low heat input, and increased compared to 10 ppm boron added steel. Furthermore, the boron segregation level maintained a maximum at intermediate heat input conditions from 60 to 500 {kJ}/cm. This is believed that the boron segregation can be reached a maximum level for relatively low heat input despite the faster cooling rate because of an increase in the boron segregation rate. Also, impact toughness decreased with increased boron content at identical heat input conditions. It is believed that the effect of segregation and precipitation of boron on deterioration of impact toughness is insignificant. However, deterioration of impact toughness may be due to the remarkable increase in the fraction of a second phase, such as the martesite–austenite (M–A) constituent, and the hardening of the matrix with increased boron content.},

Nickel additions were beneficial to strength but detrimental to impact toughness. Significant segregation of nickel and manganese to interdendritic regions was observed at the two higher nickel contents. In these weld metals a mainly martensitic microstructure developed at interdendritic regions, whereas bainite was found at dendrite core regions. The microstructural inhomogeneity was due to segregation and the accompanying stabilisation of austenite in solute enriched regions to lower transformation temperatures. With 3 wt-\% nickel the microstructure was found to be more homogeneous, with mainly bainite forming. The decrease in impact toughness with increasing nickel content was mainly attributed to the formation of coarse grained coalesced bainite.},

The treated surfaces were evaluated and characterized by means of scanning electron microscope ({SEM}), X-ray diffraction analysis, and electron dispersive spectrometry ({EDS}). The microhardness and wear experiment were also performed by using a microhardness machine and pin-on-disk tribometer. As h-{BN} reacted with titanium, an in-situ hybrid composite layer was formed showing near stoichiometric dendrites of {TiN}, platelets of {TiB} and interdendritic regions of α′-Ti martensite crystal structures. The population level of {TiN} and {TiB} regions were found to increase using a pre-placed powder mixture with greater h-{BN} content. However, the fabricated layers exhibited cracking and porosity; these were minimized by adjusting arc energy density and h-{BN} content of powder mixture. The microhardness value of the fabricated hybrid composite layers was found to be in the range of ∼650 {HV}0.2–1000 {HV}0.2; this is three to five times higher than that of the untreated {CP}-Ti substrate. In addition, the in-situ hybrid composite layers exhibited superior wear behavior over {CP}-Ti substrate; this is attributed to the formation of newly formed ceramic phases in the solidified surface layers and good coherent interface between the composite layer and {CP}-substrate. Meanwhile, severe adhesive wear mechanism of {CP}-titanium surface changed to mild abrasive one as a result of surface treatment.},
